# Statistical-Machine-Learning
## Task 1:
- Calculation if a culture of bacteria contains mutants after several generations using Markov Chains
## Task 2:
- DE: parametric density estimation: bivariate gaussian, loglikelihood, posterior, decision boundary from scratch
- NPDE: non parametric density estimation: Histogram, KDE, KNN, loglikelihood without given distribution, comparison, expectation and maximization from        scratch
